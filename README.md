How you store and keep track of a project is often far less interesting than working on the project itself. As a result, tools like Git/GitHub are often used incorrectly. This repository aims to establish some rules and guidelines of how GitHub will be used in my projects. 

I'll be going through some Git/GitHub basics in an almost tutorial-like manner. This serves both as a refresher to myself, as well as a point of reference to anyone reading this. After that, I'll be setting up the standard to which I'll be following throughout my other projects. 

It can be easy to forego the tools that are actually used in a collaborative work environment when working alone. A lot of my fellow students (and myself to a certain extent) used GitHub only as cloud storage, engaging as little as possible with the many tools that are offered. The main goal with the standard I want to create, is to more closely resemble how these tools are used in practice. The specifics of this standard will be in [Standard.md](https://github.com/sdraken/Distributed-Version-Control-101/blob/main/Standard.md), with a refresher of Git/GitHub basics in [Distributed-Version-Control-101.md](https://github.com/sdraken/Distributed-Version-Control-101/blob/main/Distributed-Version-Control-101.md)
